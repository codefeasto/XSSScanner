A very barebone/lightweight XSS Scanner that I created in late 2022 (10th grade).  

It features:
- endpoint crawling
- testing form inputs 
- testing request parameters 

**Use the `--forms` switch with caution in production environments because it has the potential to generate a lot of junk traffic.**
