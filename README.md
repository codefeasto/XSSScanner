A very barebone/lightweight Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Scanner that I created in late 2022 (10th grade).  

More on [cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting).

It features:
- endpoint crawling
- testing form inputs 
- testing request parameters 

**Use the `--forms` switch with caution in production environments because it has the potential to generate a lot of junk traffic.**
